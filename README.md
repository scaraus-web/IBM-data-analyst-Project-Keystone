## Problem Statement
The global developer ecosystem evolves rapidly, with programming languages, databases, and platforms constantly shifting in popularity.  
This project answers:  
- Which technologies dominate current usage?  
- What do developers *want* to learn next?  
- How do preferences differ by age, location, and education?  
- What strategic skills and tools will stay relevant in the future?
